features:
  - |
    Support ephemeral port. This can be used by specify 0 as the port number
    to the HTTPServer instance. In such case, an unused port will be picked up
    and the server will start listening on that port. Querying the port attribute
    after server start reveals the real port where the server is actually listening.

upgrade:
  - |
    The default port has been changed to 0, which results that the server will be staring
    on an ephemeral port.
