    Besides bytes and string, dict and MultiDict objects can be specified as query_string.
    When these objects are used, the query string gets parsed into a dict (or MultiDict),
    and comparison is made accordingly. This enables the developer to ignore the order of
    the keys in the query_string when expecting a request.
